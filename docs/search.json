    "text": "Variables\n\nIndependent variable: Democracy level of donor country\nThe data used for the analysis is the 2021 V-Dem Core dataset from Varieties of Democracy. The unit of analysis is country, and there is data for 179 countries. The dataset consists of five high-level democracy indices that each measure a specific dimension of democracy. The indices are: electoral democracy index, liberal democracy index, participatory democracy index, deliberative democracy index, and egalitarian democracy index. Each index ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating the lowest level of democracy and 1 being the highest.\nElectoral democracy index (v2x_polyarchy): measures the extent to which electoral democracy is achieved, which focuses on the responsiveness of rulers to citizens through sub-indices such as ‘clean election’, ‘freedom of expression and alternative sources of information’, ‘freedom of association’, ‘share of population with suffrage’, and ‘elected officials’. All remaining indices include the electoral democracy index as their component.\nLiberal democracy index (v2x_libdem): measures the extent to which liberal democracy is achieved, which focuses on protection of “individual and minority rights’’ from the state and the majority. The sub-indices include ‘equality before the law and individual liberty index,’ ‘judicial constraints on the executive,’ and ‘legislative constraints on the executive index.’\nParticipatory democracy index (v2x_partipdem): measures the extent to which participatory democracy is achieved, which focuses on active participation in political decision making by the citizens. Sub-indices include ‘civil society participation index,’ ‘direct popular vote index,’ ‘local government index,’ and ‘regional government index.’\nDeliberative democracy index (v2x_delibdem): measures the extent to which deliberative democracy is achieved, which focuses on making political decisions with motives for the common good. The indicators included are ‘common good,’ ‘range of consultation,’ ‘respect counterarguments,’ ‘engaged society,’ and ‘reasoned justification.’\nEgalitarian democracy index (v2x_egaldem): measures the extent to which egalitarian democracy is achieved which is when 1) there is equal protection of “rights and freedoms of individuals”, 2) equal distribution of resources among social groups, and 3) “equal access to power.” The sub-indices include ‘equal protection’, ‘equal access’, ‘equal distribution of resources.’\nThese high-level indices are type D variables, which are in turn, composed of type A, B, or C variables. Type A is coded by project managers and research assistants, B by country coordinators or research assistants, or C by country experts (multiple for each variable).\n(“Codebook” 2024)\nTo get a better understanding of the overall democracy level, I added a new index ‘v2x_average’ which is an equally weighted average of these five democracy indices.\n\n\nDependent variable: Quality of ODA\nThe quality of Official Development Assistance (ODA) is the dependent variable, measured using the QuODA 2021 dataset produced by Center for Global Development. The unit of analysis includes the 49 providers (30 bilateral, including EU, and 19 multilateral agencies). The QuODA framework measures performance on four dimensions of ODA quality: Prioritization, Ownership, Transparency & Untying, and Evaluation using 17 specific indicators.\nThe Prioritization dimension evaluates how providers decide to allocate their aid. It assesses whether the allocations are well targeted for addressing “need and long-term development challenges” (2). The specific indicators include:\n\nP1: Aid spent in partner countries\nP2: Poverty focus\nP3: Contributions to under-aided countries\nP4: Core support to multilaterals\nP5: Supporting fragile states and global public goods\n\nThe Ownership dimension measures the extent to which the providers encourage domestic ownership. The specific indicators include:\n\nO1: Alignment at objectives level\nO2: Use of country financial systems\nO3: Reliability and predictability\nO4: Partner feedback\n\nThe Transparency & Untying dimension indicates the level of transparency of information provided by the donors, including timeliness and comprehensiveness, and the degree to which the procurements are tied. The specific indicators include:\n\nT1: Aid reported in IATI\nT2: Comprehensiveness of data (CRS)\nT3: Timeliness (IATI and CRS)\nT4: Untied aid (official)\n\nThe Evaluation dimension measures the quality of the system by which the providers assess and learn from their development programs. The specific indicators include:\n\nE1: Evaluation systems\nE2: Institutional learning systems\nE3: Results-based management systems\n\n2021 indicators are derived from “in-depth analysis” by former and current experts at Center for Global Development and an independent consultant (Caitlin McKee, Catherine Blampied, Ian Mitchell and Andrew Rogerson). Editionsfrom previous years are written by experts in Brooking Institution and Center for Global Development.\nConsultant C.Mckee I.Mitchell A. Rogerson (Mitchell, Calleja, and Hughes 2021)\n\n\nSample\n\n29 bilateral agencies (countries)\nThe research uses the z-score for the overall dimensions of ODA. The sample for this research is 29 bilateral agencies who are members of the DAC (Development Assistance Committee). This research focuses on bilateral agencies as the goal is to examine the relationship between the donor government’s level of democracy and its aid quality. Among the 30 bilateral agencies, the European Union is excluded, making the total sample of the analysis 29.\n\nDisclosure: Chat GPT was used to generate the code for creating the scatter plot, adding text labels, adding caption, and table for summary of mean and range for key variables."

    "text": "Main Regression Model\nDisclosure: Chat GPT was used to generate the equation symbols.\n\\[\nY = \\alpha + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2  + \\epsilon\n\\]\n\nY = Quality of ODA\n\\(x_1\\) = Democracy level of donor country\n\\(x_2\\) = GDP per capita of donor country\n\nThe main analysis of this research will be a linear regression analysis of the quality of democracy (V-dem) in 2021 and quality of ODA (QUODA) in 2021. There will also be a more specific linear regression for the each of the dimensions of the variables.\nPotential confounder: GDP per capita\nLiterature seems to imply that altruistic nature of aid policies are indifferent to the economic capacity of the donor in that great economies like the US and Japan are not categorized as altruistic donors. Moreover, Ireland, despite being a relatively poor donor in the 1980s-90s with a small budget for aid, provided assistance primarily through multilateral channels and is categorized as an altruistic donor. Similarly, Switzerland, who also did not have large budgets for aid, continued to provide untied aid to recipient countries. (Berthélemy 2006) However, GDP per capita is included in the main regression model as a covariate in that it could still indirectly affect the quality of ODA. Larger economies may have greater surplus of resources that they can use to increase the quality of aid by better allocation and increased investment in developing better evaluation and overall ODA system. Furthermore, GDP per capita may also promote democracy. Existing literature indicates that economic development through capitalist mechanisms promotes democracy by changing the class structure.(Huber, Rueschemeyer, and Stephens 1993)\nTime: Main regression model is a cross-national analysis using the data from 2021. Thus, there is a limit to concluding the causal relationship between level of democracy and quality of ODA in that the change in quality of ODA and democracy across time is not observed. Furthermore, countries admitted in DAC are those who already meet certain criteria in their efforts and system for development cooperation.JoinDAC Thus, time may be a confounding variable in that countries who join at a later period may have lower quality of ODA.\nEmpirical extension Plot a scatterplot for average V-Dem index ranking and average QuODA dimension ranking for the previous years (2008, 209, 2012) and 2021 without the countries who joined DAC relatively recently (Slovakia, Slovenia, Czechia, Iceland, Poland, and Hungary) who also happen to have lower levels of democracy. If there is still a positive correlation, this means that the influence of having high quality democracy holds also for the more democratic countries as well and that the time at which the data was collected has little influence, strengthening the research."

This supports the hypothesis that countries with higher democracy levels will have higher quality of ODA. It can also be observed that Nordic countries, who are assessed to have altruistic, high quality ODA programs, have higher democracy scores compared to the US, UK, and Japan whose programs are more self-serving."

relationship with the quality of ODA.Thus, we accept the first hypothesis that higher the level of democracy, the higher the level of quality of ODA would be.\nHowever, the second hypothesis that the deliberative democracy would be the most strongly related dimension is rejected. While all the dimensions show significant magnitude, deliberative dimension has the smallest magnitude of 2.765. The second lowest is participatory dimension, which does not deviate too much from the second hypothesis that the participatory dimension would be the lowest. The highest dimension is electoral dimension, and liberal and egalitarian dimension have similarly large magnitudes. With regard to statistical significance, all dimensions are statistically significant, but the participatory dimension has the weakest significance.\nThis analysis also shows that the democracy level is most strongly related to ownership dimension (5.892) and transparency (4.003). Ownership is more statistically significant than transparency. Prioritization and Evaluation dimension had no statistical significance. However, Evaluation has a high magnitude of 4.284. While further research is needed, perhaps the omitting of Hungary, who has one of the lowest democracy and ODA quality level, due to missing data could have affected the statistical significance.\nThroughout the analysis, the level of wealth measured by GDP per capita had no statistical significance, supporting the argument that regime type is more significant than economic capacity in measuring quality of ODA."

    "text": "Variables\n\nIndependent variable: Democracy level of donor country\nThe data used for the analysis is the 2021 V-Dem Core dataset from Varieties of Democracy. The unit of analysis is country, and there is data for 179 countries. The dataset consists of five high-level democracy indices that each measure a specific dimension of democracy. The indices are: electoral democracy index, liberal democracy index, participatory democracy index, deliberative democracy index, and egalitarian democracy index. Each index ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating the lowest level of democracy and 1 being the highest.\nElectoral democracy index (v2x_polyarchy): measures the extent to which electoral democracy is achieved, which focuses on the responsiveness of rulers to citizens through sub-indices such as ‘clean election’, ‘freedom of expression and alternative sources of information’, ‘freedom of association’, ‘share of population with suffrage’, and ‘elected officials’. All remaining indices include the electoral democracy index as their component.\nLiberal democracy index (v2x_libdem): measures the extent to which liberal democracy is achieved, which focuses on protection of “individual and minority rights’’ from the state and the majority. The sub-indices include ‘equality before the law and individual liberty index,’ ‘judicial constraints on the executive,’ and ‘legislative constraints on the executive index.’\nParticipatory democracy index (v2x_partipdem): measures the extent to which participatory democracy is achieved, which focuses on active participation in political decision making by the citizens. Sub-indices include ‘civil society participation index,’ ‘direct popular vote index,’ ‘local government index,’ and ‘regional government index.’\nDeliberative democracy index (v2x_delibdem): measures the extent to which deliberative democracy is achieved, which focuses on making political decisions with motives for the common good. The indicators included are ‘common good,’ ‘range of consultation,’ ‘respect counterarguments,’ ‘engaged society,’ and ‘reasoned justification.’\nEgalitarian democracy index (v2x_egaldem): measures the extent to which egalitarian democracy is achieved which is when 1) there is equal protection of “rights and freedoms of individuals”, 2) equal distribution of resources among social groups, and 3) “equal access to power.” The sub-indices include ‘equal protection’, ‘equal access’, ‘equal distribution of resources.’\nThese high-level indices are type D variables, which are in turn, composed of type A, B, or C variables. Type A is coded by project managers and research assistants, B by country coordinators or research assistants, or C by country experts (multiple for each variable).\n(“Codebook” 2024)\nTo get a better understanding of the overall democracy level, I added a new index ‘v2x_average’ which is an equally weighted average of these five democracy indices.\n\n\nDependent variable: Quality of ODA\nThe quality of Official Development Assistance (ODA) is the dependent variable, measured using the QuODA 2021 dataset produced by Center for Global Development. The unit of analysis includes the 49 providers (30 bilateral, including EU, and 19 multilateral agencies). The QuODA framework measures performance on four dimensions of ODA quality: Prioritization, Ownership, Transparency & Untying, and Evaluation using 17 specific indicators.\nThe Prioritization dimension evaluates how providers decide to allocate their aid. It assesses whether the allocations are well targeted for addressing “need and long-term development challenges” (2). The specific indicators include:\n\nP1: Aid spent in partner countries\nP2: Poverty focus\nP3: Contributions to under-aided countries\nP4: Core support to multilaterals\nP5: Supporting fragile states and global public goods\n\nThe Ownership dimension measures the extent to which the providers encourage domestic ownership. The specific indicators include:\n\nO1: Alignment at objectives level\nO2: Use of country financial systems\nO3: Reliability and predictability\nO4: Partner feedback\n\nThe Transparency & Untying dimension indicates the level of transparency of information provided by the donors, including timeliness and comprehensiveness, and the degree to which the procurements are tied. The specific indicators include:\n\nT1: Aid reported in IATI\nT2: Comprehensiveness of data (CRS)\nT3: Timeliness (IATI and CRS)\nT4: Untied aid (official)\n\nThe Evaluation dimension measures the quality of the system by which the providers assess and learn from their development programs. The specific indicators include:\n\nE1: Evaluation systems\nE2: Institutional learning systems\nE3: Results-based management systems\n\n2021 indicators are derived from “in-depth analysis” by former and current experts at Center for Global Development and an independent consultant (Caitlin McKee, Catherine Blampied, Ian Mitchell and Andrew Rogerson). Editionsfrom previous years are written by experts in Brooking Institution and Center for Global Development.\nConsultant C.Mckee I.Mitchell A. Rogerson (Mitchell, Calleja, and Hughes 2021)\n\n\nSample\n\n29 bilateral agencies (countries)\nThe research uses the z-score for the overall dimensions of ODA. The sample for this research is 29 bilateral agencies who are members of the DAC (Development Assistance Committee). This research focuses on bilateral agencies as the goal is to examine the relationship between the donor government’s level of democracy and its aid quality. Among the 30 bilateral agencies, the European Union is excluded, making the total sample of the analysis 29.\n\nDisclosure: Chat GPT was used to generate the code for creating the scatter plot, adding text labels, adding caption, and table for summary of mean and range for key variables."

There will also be a more specific linear regression for the each of the dimensions of the variables.\nPotential confounder: GDP per capita\nLiterature seems to imply that altruistic nature of aid policies are indifferent to the economic capacity of the donor in that great economies like the US and Japan are not categorized as altruistic donors. Moreover, Ireland, despite being a relatively poor donor in the 1980s-90s with a small budget for aid, provided assistance primarily through multilateral channels and is categorized as an altruistic donor. Similarly, Switzerland, who also did not have large budgets for aid, continued to provide untied aid to recipient countries. (Berthélemy 2006) However, GDP per capita is included in the main regression model as a covariate in that it could still indirectly affect the quality of ODA. Larger economies may have greater surplus of resources that they can use to increase the quality of aid by better allocation and increased investment in developing better evaluation and overall ODA system. Furthermore, GDP per capita may also promote democracy. Existing literature indicates that economic development through capitalist mechanisms promotes democracy by changing the class structure.(Huber, Rueschemeyer, and Stephens 1993)\nTime: Main regression model is a cross-national analysis using the data from 2021. Thus, there is a limit to concluding the causal relationship between level of democracy and quality of ODA in that the change in quality of ODA and democracy across time is not observed. Furthermore, countries admitted in DAC are those who already meet certain criteria in their efforts and system for development cooperation.JoinDAC Thus, time may be a confounding variable in that countries who join at a later period may have lower quality of ODA.\nEmpirical extension Plot a scatterplot for average V-Dem index ranking and average QuODA dimension ranking for the previous years (2008, 209, 2012) and 2021 without the countries who joined DAC relatively recently (Slovakia, Slovenia, Czechia, Iceland, Poland, and Hungary) who also happen to have lower levels of democracy. If there is still a positive correlation, this means that the influence of having high quality democracy holds also for the more democratic countries as well and that the time at which the data was collected has little influence, strengthening the research."

relationship with the quality of ODA.Thus, we accept the first hypothesis that higher the level of democracy, the higher the level of quality of ODA would be.\nHowever, the second hypothesis that the deliberative democracy would be the most strongly related dimension is rejected. While all the dimensions show significant magnitude, deliberative dimension has the smallest magnitude of 2.765. The second lowest is participatory dimension, which does not deviate too much from the second hypothesis that the participatory dimension would be the lowest. The highest dimension is electoral dimension, and liberal and egalitarian dimension have similarly large magnitudes. With regard to statistical significance, all dimensions are statistically significant, but the participatory dimension has the weakest significance.\nThis analysis also shows that the democracy level is most strongly related to ownership dimension (5.892) and transparency (4.003). Ownership is more statistically significant than transparency. Prioritization and Evaluation dimension had no statistical significance. However, Evaluation has a high magnitude of 4.284. While further research is needed, perhaps the omitting of Hungary, who has one of the lowest democracy and ODA quality level, due to missing data could have affected the statistical significance.\nThroughout the analysis, the level of wealth measured by GDP per capita had no statistical significance, supporting the argument that regime type is more significant than economic capacity in measuring quality of ODA."
